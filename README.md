# Rex Healthify

A React Native app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Android Studio setup

1. **Install Android Studio** and the Android SDK (SDK Platform, SDK Build-Tools, Android Emulator).
2. **Set environment variables** (add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```
3. **Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)** in Android Studio: Device Manager → Create Device → pick a device and system image.
4. **Run the app on Android**: start the Expo dev server (`npm start` or `npx expo start`), then press **`a`** to open in the Android emulator, or scan the QR code with Expo Go on a physical device.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
